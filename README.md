# xG-Analysis


I've been thinking a lot about xG recently. This is a repository where I'll be looking into the measure more.


I'll do an actual write up with definitions and stuff. But for now, we boil down to two questions:

1. Is xG everything on a player-level? The idea of xG, really, is that the chance a shot can go it is largely determined by the situation surrounding the shot -- what part of the body it hits, where defenders are, where the shot is taken from, etc. There's obviously skill involved in this: it is a skill to be able to get oneself into open space. What xG suggests, though, is that, when in a given position, every player should have the same chance of scoring. That's an odd assumption -- pundits like to talk about how good players are or are not at finishing, xG suggests that finishing isn't important. I want to investigate and determine whether there are characteristics shared among players who outperform (or underperform) xG. I'm starting with data from Europe's top 5 leagues (what is typically done in the space), but I'm likely to expand out to top Women's leagues as well.
   
2. Is xG really a good predictor of outcomes? I've been playing Football Manager a lot recently (something I wouldn't suggest to do if you value your time) and I've been getting more invovled in the community. Well, really I've just been trying to figure out why my tactics don't seem to work. According to xG I have this great defense but it seems to always be leaky. People on the internet then say to look at the *type* of chances. Basically, they say that 1 0.5 xG opportunity is worth more than 5 0.1 xG opportunitites. This would break the rules of statistics. I want to determine if it's true in real life -- Are fewer, high xG opportunities (either for or against) more predictive of success than more, lower xG opportunities.
