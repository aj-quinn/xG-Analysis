# xG Analysis – Individual Player xG
## Background:
The nerds are changing sports. This happened first with baseball (we’ve all seen Moneyball) and has happened in basketball (blame Steph Curry or Daryl Morey, either way the nerds have won and teams have to shoot threes). The statistical revolution has come slower to soccer,
in some ways because there are fewer quantifiable moments. NBA games average around 42 made baskets per game[^1], EPL matches hover between 2 and 3 goals[^2] – you’re just talking about very different sample sizes.  
  
The nerds solved this problem, though, with a little thing called Expected Goals (xG). XG is actually pretty impressive (I highly suggest you read the write up from fbref: https://fbref.com/en/expected-goals-model-explained/). Basically, it looks at the entire context of a 
shot (i.e. distance, angle, what part of the body the ball is struck with, defender positions) and assigns a rating based on how many of a similar shot was scored. Easiest example is this: penalty kicks have an xG of 0.78 because they’re scored 78% of the time.  
  
When you think about it, though, there feels like there’s something missing from xG. It’s all about the context of the shot – where it’s taken from, where the opposition is – it doesn’t take into account at all how good the shooter is at finishing. I think it is a fair 
assumption that some players should be better than average at shooting the ball: maybe they kick the ball harder than other players so it is harder for the goalkeeper to block, or maybe they are better at kicking the ball into a part of the goal the goalkeeper can’t reach.
  
More than that, though, I feel like we almost look down on players scoring above their xG. We act as if it surely must be a statistical anomaly and that their scoring will revert to the mean. In effect, we act as if we shouldn’t expect players to outperform xG – we assume 
finishing isn’t a skill some players will be better at than others.  
  
Ultimately, there’s only one question to answer: do certain players consistently out-perform their xG? And, if so, what characteristics define those players?
